1. Does order of operations matter? I tried to delete and then create in app.js but the order was reverse
2. Why do we need schema? What if it's not present?
3. I updated the schema. Then I tried to use Campground.update instead of dropping the db entirely and recreating contents. It didn't update the db with description. I manually ran the same cmd on mongo shell and that updated it though.
